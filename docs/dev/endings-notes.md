# Secret endings: notes for whoever works on the code

The main file is `modules/server/sv_livingcity_endings.lua`, with its client side in `modules/client/cl_livingcity_endings.lua`. The G-Man offers a vote; the endings are:

- harpies, bus, plane, standup, hard, base, marrow, bloom, water (the flood), shalom (the hora), fire (behinds on fire, then flying on them)

Each ending has a song and its own `lc_ending_<name>_*` cvars, all documented in `docs/features/endings.md`.

Things worth knowing:

- **Archived server cvars keep their old values,** so changing a default doesn't reach existing servers. `LC.EndingRetune()` and its `RETUNED` table move exact old defaults to new ones. Add to that table whenever a default changes.
- **Song timing comes from a clock started when the song began playing** (`songAt` / SongClock on the client), because a BASS VBR mp3's GetTime drifts.
- **Things that fly are kept under the sky** with `LC.EndingCeilingAt` / `LC.EndingSky` (the bus, the plane, and Base's fleet). On the ground, the bus may drive through buildings; the owner likes that.
- **Placement uses `Ground()` and `RingSpot`,** which fall back to `LC.NavNodesNear`, because the map's landing zone is up on a roof.
- **Spectators (the dead):** `EndKey` and `LC.EndingPollKeys()` poll keys, because KeyPress doesn't always fire for spectators. Jump toggles free flight (OBS_MODE_ROAM).
- **ClientsideModels don't animate by themselves** (the G-Man), so their cycle is driven by hand.
- **Dances are bone manipulation on ValveBiped:** see "Bone poses" in `CORE.md`, section "How the code must be written" (roll on the head is a twist, not a nod).
- **An ending in progress:** `LC.EndingSession()` returns its state (nil when none). It now gates:
  - the city events
  - the announcer and voice clips
  - the ambient music
  - the breencast
  - Civil Protection inspections (underground stops)
  - `LC.ReportCrime`
  - negative `LC.AddStanding`
